|:--------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| quotes_scraper_splash.py        | The code imports necessary libraries, pulls HTML content using Splash from a given URL, extracts specific information using CSS selectors and compiles the resulting data into a dictionary. The extracted info in this case pertains to quotes and their respective authors.                                                   |
| quotes_scraper_requests_html.py | This code uses the requests_html library to scrape quotes and their authors from a webpage. It renders the webpage, extracts the relevant text using specified selectors, and converts the data into a dictionary format. The function is then called when the script is run.                                                   |
| quotes_scraper_playwright.py    | The code snippet uses Playwright to automate web scraping of quotes and their authors from a website. It then converts the scraped data into a dictionary format using the quotes_list_to_dict function. The code launches Chromium, navigates to the specified URL, extracts data using CSS selectors, and closes the browser. |
| utils.py                        | This code imports the `json` library and defines the URL and selectors for a web scraping project. The `quotes_list_to_dict` function takes two lists of quotes and authors and converts them into a dictionary format. It then writes the resulting data into a `quotes.json` file using the `json.dump` function.                 |
