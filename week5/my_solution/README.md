| plot_perf_benchmark.py       | The code defines a function to plot data from a CSV file into a horizontal bar graph. The data is extracted and sorted before being plotted with xkcd styling. The function also saves the plot as an image file and displays the graph.                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| unsplash_image_downloader.py | The provided code is an image downloader that scrapes Unsplash for free images based on a given keyword and downloads them using four different methods-requests, requests session, aiohttp, and threadpoolexecutor. It includes an option to benchmark all downloader methods and output a performance report with a plot. The code also provides an argparse interface for user input.                                     |
| downloaders.py               | The provided code snippet offers four different image download functions that use various libraries and techniques such as requests, aiohttp, and ThreadPoolExecutor to download images concurrently. These functions take a keyword, a list of image links, and the number of images to download, and save the images in a specified base folder. The tqdm library is used to display progress bars during image downloads. |

### 2. Downloading 30 spider images from unsplash

```
python unsplash_image_downloader.py --keyword spider --image_count 30 --benchmark 3
```

 - The same set of images is downloaded using all download methods.
 - This is repeated 3 times to get an average of the elapsed time.
 - The benchmark scores are stored as a CSV.
 - The benchmark scores CSV is plotted, and the plot is saved to a file.
