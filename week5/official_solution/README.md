| main.py     | The provided code snippet has three main functions. First, it retrieves a list of high-resolution images' URLs related to a given search term from the Unsplash website. Second, it filters out some unsuitable URLs from the retrieved ones. Finally, it downloads and saves a specified number of images to a given destination directory. The code heavily relies on third-party packages such as httpx and selectolax.parser and uses Python's logging module for informing the user about the process's progress. |
| main_api.py | The provided code snippet allows for scraping and downloading images from Unsplash based on a given keyword and number of desired results. The code uses the httpx library to send API requests and retrieve JSON data, and includes functions for extracting image URLs, downloading images, and iterating through multiple pages of results.                                                                                                                                                                         |
